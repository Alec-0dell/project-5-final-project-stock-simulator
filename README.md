Final Project
Alec Odell and Zubin Sannakkayala 

For our final project we are going to produce a stock watch list app that will let you practice with fake money.
There will be a title fragemnt before entering the main body of the app.
Then there will be a recycler page that will list the stocks the user has invested in and some other popular options. 
Clicking on a stock within the recyler view will allow the user to 'buy' or 'sell' their stock as well as providing more in depth information.
Additionaly, there will be a summary page that will help summarize the effectiveness of the users stategy. 

Skills being used: 
Recycler view
Nav manager
Alternative landscape orientations
External stock price tools
All of the basics of layout design
